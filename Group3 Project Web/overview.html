        <h3>A. Overview</h3>
        <p>
          Cagayan State University at Lal-lo is situated on a mountaintop
          towering over the municipality of Lal-lo, total remaining land area of
          861 hectares from each original area of 1,727 hectares. It is
          approximately 2.7 kilometers from the national road, eight (8)
          kilometers from the town proper, and seventy (70) kilometers from
          Tuguegarao City. Bounded by the north with the municipality of
          Camalaniugan, east by the municipalities of Buguey and Sta. Teresita,
          south Gattaran and west the Cagayan River and the Municipality of
          Allacapan. The school campus, which is the hub of activities, occupies
          an area of 20 hectares. The rest of the reservation within the campus
          premises is utilized for income generating activities, which include
          the following: coconut plantation, carabao ranch, swine project, goat
          and sheep project, corn production, vegetable production, and forest
          tree crops to include Cacao, coffee and mango under the National
          Greening program and CSU-DBP forest project, while the rest are being
          occupied by illegal settlers for long time ago as the campus does not
          have enough manpower to farm/cultivate these idle lands. <br /><br />
          Despite of the Covid 19 pandemic and the nationwide outbreak of the
          African Swine Fever that seriously affects the agricultural sector for
          more than 2 years, the Cagayan State University at Lal-lo Business
          Affairs Office still continuously perform its mandate and functions in
          generating income from its different IGE projects both animal and crop
          production. Thus, it helps in easing the problem of food shortage in
          the country as well as helps generate income for the university or
          campus to continuously deliver its four fold function in the
          community.

        <h3>B. Campus Business Banner Project</h3>
        <p>
          The campus banner project is crop production particularly corn and
          other high value crops to include vegetable and other leguminous
          crops. This is so because CSU Lal-lo has vast agricultural land
          suitable for crop production. However, these crop production areas are
          solely dependent to rainwater making it hard for the Business office
          to produce the needed production output. The unpredictable and
          uncontrollable weather condition like typhoons and early dry spell is
          also and added problem which cause major damages to standing crops
          leading sometimes to a production loss or break-even. Because of these
          phenomenon, the campus has decided to shift into coffee as its banner
          project thus, it has already revived its old coffee plantation at
          Valena site with approximate area of more or less 15 hectares. Pruning
          and under-brushing is currently undertaken to some trees to improve
          their fruit bearing capacity, Coffee trees pruned are now rejuvenating
          and expected to bear fruits after 3 years. Other trees continuously
          bear fruits thus, harvesting is on-going. With the provision of coffee
          processing equipment by DOST, the project is expected to generate
          additional revenue to the campus as its product Valena Heritage Coffee
          is already known to the market.

        <h3>C. Campus Business Resources Available</h3>
        <p>
          1. Physical – land, building, machineries, equipment With the limited
          manpower of the Business Affairs office of the campus, areas feasible
          for crop and animal production cannot be maximized nor expand, thus,
          it has only the following projects with corresponding
          resources/inventories. These projects/business resources also serves
          as training/laboratory ground for students for its agriculture program
          courses, the DAT and the BSA program. <br /><br />

          1. Corn Production Project – Approximately 19 hectares is available. 9
          hectares is located at western side of the school campus and another
          10 hectares on the eastern side (Valena site). For the main cropping
          season covering the period January-May 2022, a total of 15 hectares
          was planted with hybrid corn harvesting more than 1,300 cavans
          fresh(50 kg capacity) and generating a gross sales of P802,594. For
          the second (wet) cropping season covering the period July to October,
          the business office planted only 10 hectares because of typhoon risk.
          A total of 700 cavans fresh shelled corn was harvested with a gross
          sales of 427,000. Harvests yield should have been more if the crops
          should not have been damaged by typhoon Florita in late August, on the
          crops late maturity stage. As of December 2022, the business office
          had already planted 12 hectares area using a hand tractor hitched
          seeder with fertilizer applicator. Planting is still on-going for the
          remaining 7 hectares at Valena site.
          <br /><br />

          2. Cassava Production Project. To maximized all areas within the
          campus premises, the business office also established in July a 1.5
          hectare cassava plantation and ¾ hectare banana. Cassava is expected
          to bear tubers after 9 months while banana is expected to bear flowers
          after 10 months as the variety planted is the “Saba” variety.
          <br /><br />

          3. Vegetable Production Project. In support to the food production
          program of the government to ease the effect of food shortage, the
          business office also planted an area of 1.5 hectares with squash on
          May of this year. More than 8 tons of fruits was harvested from this
          enterprise, generating a gross sales of P110,000. Another ½ hectare
          area was again planted with the same vegetable crop last November.
          However, due to continuous rains and cold weather up to December, the
          crops were severely affected by the adverse weather condition thus, a
          gross income of P10,000 was only generated from this ½ hectare area
          planted.
          <br /><br />

          4. Carabeef Project (15 hectares ranch)- As of December 30, 2022,
          stocks totaling to 31 heads consisting of the following: carabull 1,
          caracow 10, draft animal 2, yearling caracow 5, yearling carabull 4,

          <br /><br />

          5. Sheep/ Goat Project (6 hectares pasture) – located at the northern
          portion of the school campus with approximate area of 6 hectares
          improved pasture. For the period of January- to December, 2022, the
          project was able to produce 23 heads of sheep. Inventory as of
          December 2022 now totaling to 92 heads consisting the following: ram
          2; ewe 37; weanling ewe 13, weanling ram 5, lamb ram 21 and lamb ewe

          project) stocks now totaling to 49 heads consisting of 11 sows, 1
          boar, 11 growers, 22 weaners, and 4 sucklings.
          <br /><br />

          7. Cattle Project(Meat type) located at the coconut plantation
          adjacent to the school campus. Stocks were taken from the department
          of Agriculture in mid-2018 consisting of 10 heifer Brahman breeds. For
          January- November. 2022, the project was able to produce 10 heads of
          calf. Stocks now totaling to 32 heads consisting the following:
          Breeder bull 1; cow 13; heifer 4, bull 4; calf 10, female stocks are
          all intended for breeding/production purposes.
          <br /><br />

          8. Piggery Project(Hybrid)- With the outbreak of the dreaded African
          Swine Fever that almost wiped out the Hog industry in the region in
          2019 including CSU Lal-lo, The Cagayan State University at Lal-lo was
          able to solicit funds amounting to 3 million pesos for the
          establishment of an ASF free piggery project under the Hog
          repopulation program of the department of Agriculture. As of reporting
          date, the repair of the old piggery building has already been finished
          including the provision of fixtures and equipment like automatic
          fattening and farrowing crates. The business office is now just only
          waiting for the delivery of gilt that was been ordered to make the
          project operational.
          <br /><br />

          9. Mango Production Project- located at the western side of the campus
          with around 5 hectares area with only around 100 remaining trees.
          Majority of the trees were been toppled down/uprooted by previous
          super typhoons. However, there is an additional 200 productive trees
          that are also owned by farmer beneficiaries planted/scattered within
          the campus reservation areas. For this harvesting year (May) the
          business office was able to harvest around 4 tons of fresh mango
          fruits generating a gross income of P85,400. Spraying with flower
          inducer is set to be started January of 2023, if it will be done,
          harvesting is expected April-May of 2023.
          <br /><br />

          10. Old Coffee Plantation Project – Situated at Valena site with
          around 15 hectares. Trees are still bearing fruits but needs
          maintenance (under-brushing and pruning) as it was already overgrown
          by second growth trees, besides, trees are already 3 decades old.
          Lately, the university extension office funded the rehabilitation of
          the said plantation thus, pruning and under-brushing is on-going.
          Pruned trees are expected to rejuvenate and bear fruits after 2-3
          years while unpruned trees are still continuously bearing fruits, thus
          harvesting of ripened berries is on-going.
          <br /><br />

          11. Coconut Project – situated at the southwestern part of the school
          campus with an approximate area of 5 hectares. Trees are still bearing
          fruit but needs to be replaced as the trees are already old and some
          are already unproductive. However, replanting/replacing trees with new
          ones cannot be undertaken as the area was already been utilized as
          pasture (grazing) area for the cattle project. As of this year 2022,
          the project was able to generate an income P50,000 from the sales of
          green and dried nuts.
          <br /><br />
          12. Food Court- Building is located inside the school Campus. It has 7
          stalls constructed 15 years ago. However due to the effect of the
          Covid 19 pandemic prohibiting face to face learning mode, the building
          was idle for two years. The building really needs major repair,
          however, due to limited supply of lumber, minor repair was only been
          undertaken in September to make it usable for the opening of the face
          to face learning mode. At present, all stalls are all been
          occupied/rented by new operators. These operators are charged a
          monthly rental of P1,600/month. As of December 2022, the project was
          already able to generate P61,305 gross income from this business
          enterprise.
          <br /><br />

          13. Cap and Gown Rentals- It has 500 sets of cap and gown
          made/manufactured in 2019 for rent to graduating students. However
          because of the effect of the K-12 program of the government coupled
          with the effect of the Covid 19 pandemic which only allows virtual
          graduation, investment became idle. However, total investment has
          already been repaid in the previous years. Last July 2022 graduation
          exercises, the campus was able to generate a gross income of P85,400
          from this enterprise from CSU Lal-lo and Lasam graduates.
          <br /><br />

          14. Citronella Production Project- With the collaboration of the
          Business office and research and extension office, the BAO office
          headed by the undersigned also established a citronella production
          project sometime in 2020 intended for the production of citronella
          planting materials and for processing. Last September of 2022, the
          business office was able to sell 110,000 citronella tillers (planting
          materials) to a farmer cooperator in Sta. Maria Isabela. A gross
          income of P270,000 was generated from this project all deposited under
          the IGP funds
          <br /><br />

          15. SMART Tower - With the initiative of the previous Campus Executive
          Officer Dr. Ricardo Casauay and the undersigned, the campus also
          initiated for the offering of an area for the construction of SMART
          tower in the campus. Thus, a cell site tower was constructed sometime
          in 2020. Last December 2022, the campus had already received the
          accumulated rental fee amounting to P519,000.00. Monthly rentals from
          this tower is P25,000 per month.

        <h3>3. Financial Resources</h3>
        <p>
          As of September 30, 2022, gross income from all income generating
          projects (crops, animal and rentals) now totaling to 1,794,952.
          However this amount is expected to decrease by the end of 4th quarter
          of 2022 as it is again the start of the corn production period. Hence,
          outflows for the purchase of agricultural inputs like seeds and
          fertilizers expected.

          Before a project has to be implemented, a business proposal or a
          simple cost and return analysis have to be prepared to determine its
          feasibility. Projects proposals found to be feasible are then
          identified and implemented. A project leader or in-charge with the
          appropriate line of specialization and experience will then be
          designated to oversee the overall-all implementation and smooth
          operation of the project. All inputs and labor needed will be
          identified and supplies needed will be purchased beforehand following
          the government approved procurement system. During the implementation
          of the project, monitoring is regularly being done by the Business
          Coordinator to determine status and make recommendation for possible
          improvement. At the end of the cropping period or year, projects are
          evaluated to determine whether pre-determined objectives being set has
          been attained. The result would be the basis in improving,
          maintaining, and or dissolving the project.

        <h3>Problems Encountered Related to Campus Business Program</h3>

        <p>
          The unpredictable and changing weather condition is a big problem.
          Some of our crops are sometimes subjected to unfavorable weather
          condition like drought and strong typhoons. As a result, a negative
          income and or break even are sometimes experienced by some crop and
          animal projects. The insufficiency of manpower to perform the daily
          activities in the different projects is also a problem. For an
          agricultural campus like Lal-lo with vast agricultural land and
          different agricultural projects, it lacks laborer 1 positions to be
          assigned as farm workers. Some plantilla positions for farm workers
          who retired in the service were taken away to central administration,
          while some agricultural related positions like technicians were
          detailed to some offices and do/perform other works. For an
          agricultural projects to succeed, it should have ready and enough
          manpower. This situation is a big contributory factor for the failure
          of some projects as they are not taken cared off well. <br /><br />

          Delay in the release of salaries of hired laborers is also problem.
          Some hired labors usually fails to report when needed as they need
          immediate cash for their family expenditures. As a result, they have
          to look for other employer that would give them a daily cash wages.
          This situation delays activities that must have to be undertaken which
          sometimes affect the operation of the project particularly crop
          production project.
          <br /><br />

          Delays in the procurement of supplies and materials needed by the
          different projects is also another problem. Sometimes it take weeks
          and sometimes months for a requested supplies before it has to be
          purchased/delivered. This situation usually affects the over-all
          operation and viability of projects.
          <br /><br />

          Insufficiency of security guards to oversee and protect animal, crops,
          as well as plantation projects from intruders is also a problem. With
          their limited number, only 6 security guards, they can only secure the
          campus proper, thus projects are sometimes at risk.
